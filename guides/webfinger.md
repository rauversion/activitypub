Let's outline a basic Webfinger implementation for our Rails context:

### 1. Webfinger Route

First, you need to add a route that will respond to Webfinger queries:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
get '/.well-known/webfinger', to: 'webfinger#show'
```

### 2. Webfinger Controller

Then, create a controller that handles the Webfinger requests:

```ruby
# app/controllers/webfinger_controller.rb
class WebfingerController < ApplicationController
  def show
    account = params[:resource].sub('acct:', '')

    user = User.find_by(webfinger_account: account)
    
    if user
      render json: {
        subject: "acct:#{user.webfinger_account}",
        links: [
          {
            rel: 'self',
            type: 'application/activity+json',
            href: user_activitypub_url(user)
          }
        ]
      }
    else
      render status: :not_found
    end
  end
end
```

### 3. User Model

You might need a method or attribute for the user's ActivityPub URL. Here's a simple example, assuming `User` has an `username` field:

```ruby
# app/models/user.rb
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def webfinger_account
    "#{username}@#{Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host]}"
  end

  def activitypub_url(user)
    "https://your-domain.com/activitypub/users/#{user.id}"
  end
end
```

### 4. Configuration & Middleware

Make sure you have the necessary CORS headers set up, as remote servers will need to access the Webfinger endpoint.

Additionally, consider caching the Webfinger responses, since the data doesn't change frequently. This will reduce the load on your server.

### 5. Documentation

Lastly, document your Webfinger endpoint, so developers from other services know how to discover users on your platform. You might want to link to the official Webfinger specification for further details.

With these steps, you should have a basic Webfinger implementation that allows other servers to discover users on your platform via their `@user@domain.com` identifier.
