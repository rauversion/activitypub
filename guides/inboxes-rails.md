### Implementing ActivityPub Inbox and Outbox in Rails

#### 1. Database Setup:

To store incoming and outgoing activities, you'll need to set up the appropriate database tables.

```bash
rails generate model Activity content:text actor:references type:string object:references target:references published:datetime
```

Then run `rails db:migrate`.

#### 2. Routes:

Define routes for the inbox and outbox.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :actors do
  member do
    post :inbox
    get :outbox
  end
end
```

#### 3. Controller:

Set up your controller to handle the incoming and outgoing requests.

```ruby
# app/controllers/actors_controller.rb
class ActorsController < ApplicationController
  def inbox
    # Parse the incoming ActivityPub request.
    activity = ActivityPub::Activity.from_h(params.require(:activity).permit!)

    # Process the incoming activity.
    case activity.type
    when "Create"
      # Handle the creation of a new activity.
    when "Follow"
      # Handle a new follow request.
    end

    # Respond to the request.
    head :created
  end

  def outbox
    # For the sake of simplicity, we're just displaying all activities related to an actor.
    @activities = Activity.where(actor: params[:id])
  end
end
```

#### 4. Model:

Your `Activity` model will hold the core logic for processing activities.

```ruby
# app/models/activity.rb
class Activity < ApplicationRecord
  belongs_to :actor
  
  # You can add validation and methods to process specific activity types.
  
  validates :type, presence: true
  
  def process_incoming
    # Logic to process an incoming activity.
  end

  def send_outgoing
    # Logic to send an outgoing activity.
  end
end
```

#### 5. Views:

You may or may not need views, as a lot of this is server-to-server communication. However, for the outbox, it's useful to have a visual representation.

```erb
<!-- app/views/actors/outbox.html.erb -->
<% @activities.each do |activity| %>
  <div class="activity">
    <strong>Type:</strong> <%= activity.type %><br>
    <strong>Content:</strong> <%= activity.content %><br>
    <!-- Add more fields as necessary -->
  </div>
<% end %>
```

#### 6. Processing Activities:

When receiving an activity in the inbox, you'll want to process it according to its type. This could be acknowledging a follow request, storing a new note or message, updating your local state based on a delete activity, etc.

When sending an activity from the outbox, you'll want to serialize your activity to the correct format, ensure you're addressing it to the correct recipients, handle any necessary authentication or HTTP signatures, and handle possible failures in delivery.

#### 7. Integration with ActivityPub:

Ensure that you integrate the ActivityPub-specific functionalities, like HTTP Signatures, JSON-LD parsing, etc.

### Tips:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep the ActivityPub logic separate from your core application logic. Consider using service objects or separate classes/modules to encapsulate ActivityPub-specific behaviors.

- **Security:** Ensure you're verifying any incoming requests to ensure they're genuine. HTTP Signatures are a key component of this for ActivityPub.

- **Testing:** Given the complexity of server-to-server interactions and the various ways an activity can be formatted, testing is crucial. Use Rails' testing capabilities along with libraries like `webmock` to mock external requests.

- **Documentation:** The ActivityPub specification is thorough but can be dense. Regularly refer back to it, and consider looking at other implementations or communities for guidance.

By following the above guidance and building upon the basic setup provided, you should be able to effectively implement and customize an ActivityPub inbox and outbox in a Rails app.
